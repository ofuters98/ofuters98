# <h1 align="center">**Hello! My name is Owen! 👋**</h1>

## <p align="center">I’m an aspiring software engineer based in Stafford, England.</p>

### My background:

After obtaining a degree in Film Studies during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic,
I was left in a difficult situation where it was becoming increasingly challenging (more so than it would have been normally)
to find work in the film industry.

I went on to take up a couple of different roles in other sectors, none of which were my cup of tea. 
Eventually, this pushed me to start exploring other potential career opportunities.

This is where I stepped into the world of tech for the first time. 
I began teaching myself how to develop web pages using **HTML** and **CSS** and as a result, discovered a love for coding.

Ultimately, this made me want to delve deeper into the way in which computers work, 
and as a result I ended up taking a **Skills Bootcamp in Software Engineering.**
